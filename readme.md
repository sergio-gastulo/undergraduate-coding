# Undergraduate Coding Homework

A collection of code from my undergraduate studies in Mathematics. Nothing fancy -- just homework and assignments I worked on during college, now revisited and (hopefully) improved.

Could be useful for students of the Mathematics career at UNI, Lima. 

### Directories

- `cpp` and `py`: Original code, unmodified. Included as a reference to show how my programming skills have evolved over time. Will be eventually removed after improving code. 

- `cpp_v` and `py_v`: Updated versions of the code above, revised with better practices and improvements.
